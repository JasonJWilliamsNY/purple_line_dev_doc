Accessing Saved Private and Public DNA Subway Projects
------------------------------------------------------

DNA Subway projects are automatically saved for registered users. By default,
Subway projects are private upon creation and visible only to you. You may
make project public, in which case users will have the ability to view those
projects, but may not edit those projects.
