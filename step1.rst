DNA Subway Basics and Logging in to Subway
--------------------------------------------
DNA Subway is designed to be a classroom-friendly approach to bioinformatics.
Unlike most CyVerse platforms, you can even use Subway without registering for
a CyVerse account. We do encourage you to register however, only work from
registered users can be saved. DNA Subway uses the same open-source
bioinformatics tools used by researchers. See a `complete list of the tools <https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/about/resources.html>`_
provided in the Subway pipelines.

.. #### Comment: short description

**Some things to remember about the platform**

*Registered user and Guest user account types*

- DNA Subway access must be requested through the CyVerse user portal. You can
  check if you already have access, or request access by logging into the portal
  and visiting the `My Services <https://user.cyverse.org/services/mine>`_ page.
  If DNA Subway is not listed, click on `Available <https://user.cyverse.org/services/available>`_
  services to request access.
- Guest users will not have their worked saved beyond a single DNA Subway
  session. They are also disallowed from using one of the gene predictors
  (FGenesH) in the genomic annotation pipeline (Red Line).
- We suggest that every student using DNA Subway obtain their own account.

*Sample Datasets and reference data*

All Subway lines accept user data and also have sample data that can be
immediately used to create a project.

- **Red Line - Genome Annotation:** Samples of plant and animal genomes that can
  be used in annotation projects
- **Yellow Line - TARGeT Search for transposons and other DNA Sequences:**
  Several model plant genomes
- **Blue Line - DNA Barcoding and Phylogenetics:** Sample sequence from plant,
  animal, fungal, and bacterial barcoding regions; human mitochondrial DNA
  sequence
- **Green Line - RNA-Seq for differential expression:** Sample high-throughput
  reads from RNA-Seq experiments

If there is a reference data set or sample sequence you would like added, you
can contact CyVerse using the DNA Subway `Contact page <https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/feedback.html>`_

*Public and private projects*
- DNA Subway projects are private by default, but can be shared by making them
public. Public projects are searchable and are a great way to share data or
present analysis for grading in a classroom project.

*Logging into DNA Subway as a registered user*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Access the DNA Subway website at `https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/ <https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/>`_

  2. If you wish to use DNA Subway as a guest click 'Enter As Guest'

    .. Note::
       When using DNA Subway as a guest, you will be able to work only on the
       Red, Yellow, and Blue lines. Additionally, some Red Line functionalities
       will be disabled. Finally, after logging out, or a period of inactivity
       (>~ 30 min) you work will be discarded.

  3. Enter your CyVerse username and CyVerse password.


*Logging into DNA Subway as a guest user*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  1. Access the DNA Subway website at `https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/ <https://dnasubway.cyverse.org/>`_
     ;click 'Enter as Guest'

	#### Comment: Suggested style guide:
	1. Steps begin with a verb or preposition: Click on... OR Under the "Results Menu"
	2. Locations of files listed parenthetically, separated by carets, ultimate object in bold
	(Username > analyses > *output*)
	3. Buttons and/or keywords in bold: Click on **Apps** OR select **Arabidopsis**
	4. Primary menu titles in double quotes: Under "Input" choose...
	5. Secondary menu titles or headers in single quotes: For the 'Select Input' option choose...
